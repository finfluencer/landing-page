## üîß Technical Implementation

### Form Structure

Each form includes:

```html
<form
  name="form-name"
  method="POST"
  data-netlify="true"
  data-netlify-honeypot="bot-field"
>
  <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="form-name" />
  <input type="hidden" name="bot-field" />
  <!-- Form fields -->
</form>
```

### JavaScript Submission

```javascript
const response = await fetch("/", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" },
  body: new URLSearchParams({
    "form-name": "form-name",
    field1: value1,
    field2: value2,
  }).toString(),
});
```

### Static Form Detection

The `public/forms.html` file ensures Netlify detects all forms during build time - this is crucial for SPA form handling.

## üìà Analytics & Tracking

### Built-in Analytics

- **Submission Rates**: Track form conversion rates
- **Spam Detection**: Monitor blocked submissions
- **Form Performance**: See which forms perform best

### Custom Tracking

Add Google Analytics or other tracking:

```javascript
// Track form submissions
gtag("event", "form_submit", {
  form_name: "hero-email-capture",
  value: 1,
});
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Forms not detected**:

   - Ensure `public/forms.html` is included in build
   - Check form names match exactly
   - Verify data-netlify="true" attribute

2. **Submissions not working**:

   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify form method="POST"
   - Ensure hidden form-name field matches form name

3. **Spam issues**:
   - Enable Akismet in Netlify settings
   - Add reCAPTCHA for high-traffic forms
   - Monitor honeypot field effectiveness

### Testing Forms

1. **Local Development**:

   - Forms won't work locally (Netlify needed)
   - Use Netlify Dev for local testing: `netlify dev`

2. **Production Testing**:
   - Test each form after deployment
   - Check submissions appear in Netlify dashboard
   - Verify email notifications work
